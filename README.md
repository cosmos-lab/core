About OrientedJS

https://orientedjs.com/

OrientedJS is an object oriented approach to achive data driven dynamic HTML with the power of ECMAScript.
A radical approach to plan HTML based UI...

#Put HTML template in a seprate *.html file and encapsulate all UI logics/data/event handlers inside an ECMAScript class in a standard *.js javascript file.

#Serve UI resources over HTTP via any webserver (Node.js, Apache or nginx).

#Gives you more control over your UI architecture to design it in your own ways, because most of the application is driven by your ECMAScript classes. ORN is just to create a dynamic HTML into a container from scope data ('this' or any javascript object) & HTML template (inline or external *.html file).
